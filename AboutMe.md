Currently, I am working to obtain the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, where I am developing technical competencies in network security, threat detection, and incident response. My diverse background has endowed me with a unique set of transferable skills that make me an excellent fit for a help desk role in cybersecurity.  

One of my key strengths is meticulous attention to detail. At Waffle House, I ensure every meal is prepared exactly to order, maintaining high standards of cleanliness and safety. This attention to detail is crucial in cybersecurity, where identifying and addressing small vulnerabilities can prevent significant security breaches. 

I also excel under pressure. During peak hours at Waffle House, I managed multiple orders while maintaining quality and efficiency. This experience has taught me to stay calm and focused in high-stress situations, which is essential for responding to urgent security incidents.  

Problem-solving is another key skill I possess. As a Prep Cook at a Korean restaurant, I frequently encountered and resolved issues like sudden menu changes, language barriers, lack of instructions, or equipment malfunctions. My ability to think quickly and find practical solutions is directly applicable to a help desk role, where swift resolution of technical problems is essential.

Additionally, I have strong communication and collaboration skills. As a Lead Customer Service Representative at Speedway LLC, I managed customer interactions and resolved conflicts, requiring clear communication and teamwork. These skills are vital in cybersecurity for coordinating responses to security incidents and explaining technical issues to non-technical users.  

I am enthusiastic about bringing my attention to detail, ability to thrive under pressure, problem-solving abilities, and communication skills to a cybersecurity help desk role. I am confident that my background uniquely positions me to excel and make a significant impact on your team.
